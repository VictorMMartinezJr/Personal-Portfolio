          About Me
        </h1>
        <p className="mt-4 px-4 sm:text-2xl">
          I'm Victor, a full-stack developer skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
          React, TailwindCSS, Spring Boot, and MySQL. I recently completed an
          indoor navigation app as part of a summer internship with my college's
          Computer Science department leaders. I currently have a 4.0 GPA and
          was chosen to represented my college at the SkillsUSA programming
          competition.
        </p>
        <p className="my-4 px-4 sm:text-2xl">
          After completing the navigation app, I was invited to become a
          founding member and team leader of a new innovation-driven student
          club. I'm excited about the vision for the student club and the chance
          to lead, mentor, and help other students grow as full-stack developers
          â€” especially with the added potential of integrating AI and
          collaborating under a funded NITIC grant.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 px-4 sm:text-2xl">
          I'm currently seeking a software engineering job where I can use my
          current experience and leadership skills to keep pushing my limits,
          learn from experienced engineers, and become the best developer I can
          be.
